Welcome to the Decipher Challenge repository! This project includes a series of Python scripts designed to analyze, manipulate, and visualize data from text files as part of a decryption challenge. Below is a comprehensive guide to the features and usage of the provided scripts.
## Features
File Analysis: Analyze the content of text files to count the number of periods ('.') and split the file into segments.
Frequency Analysis: Perform letter frequency analysis to compare ciphered text frequencies with typical English letter frequencies.
File Comparison: Compare two files to identify differences line by line.
Character Mapping: Apply custom mappings to characters in text files.
Data Visualization: Plot data points from text files using scatter plots.
